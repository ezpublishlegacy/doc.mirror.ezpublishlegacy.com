    <h1>Introduction to the eZ Publish Cloud</h1>
    <div class=3D"Section1">
        <p>This documentation gives you a brief introduction to our Cloud S=
olution for eZ Publish.</p>
<p>The eZ Publish Cloud Service provides you a scalable, secure and easy wa=
y to host your eZ Publish installation.</p>
<h2 id=3D"IntroductiontotheeZPublishCloud-BasicConcepts">Basic Concepts</h2=
>
<p>eZ Publish Cloud is based on three basic concepts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Environments</li>
<li>Stages</li>
<li>Deployments</li>
</ol>
<h3 id=3D"IntroductiontotheeZPublishCloud-Environments">Environments</h3>
<p>The first basic concept is the environment. An environment encapsulates =
all your data and separates it from the data of other customers.&nbsp;<span=
>An environment is in a on to one relationship with a service subscription.=
 Each environment can hold one productive (public accessible) eZ Publish In=
stallation (which can of course have multiple site accesses).</span></p>
<p><span>The environment is also the entity on which permissions are grante=
d. This means, that a user, who has access to a certain environment, can se=
e and edit all settings of the whole environment including all stages and d=
eployments.</span></p>
<h3 id=3D"IntroductiontotheeZPublishCloud-Stages">Stages</h3>
<p>Each environment is separated into 3 Stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Staging</li>
<li>Live</li>
<li>Rollback</li>
</ul>
<p>The three stages define three areas in your environment, where your eZ P=
ublish installations live. It is quite similar to a classical software dist=
ribution process where you have a development environment (not provided by =
eZ Publish Cloud), a testing environment (staging stage) and a production e=
nvironment (live stage). The eZ Publish Cloud provides you another stage (R=
ollback). The Rollback stage keeps older installations for a quick reset, i=
n case something goes wrong with the installation in production.</p>
<p>The stages can be seen as tags for deployments, which define how the dep=
loyment is treated and which actions for the Deployment are available. The =
stages provide no physical or virtual separation of the contained deploymen=
ts. All deployments are equally treated, no matter in which stage the deplo=
yment resides.</p>
<h3 id=3D"IntroductiontotheeZPublishCloud-Deployments">Deployments</h3>
<p>The last concept is the deployment.<strong> A deployment is basically a =
complete and&nbsp;independent&nbsp;eZ Publish&nbsp;installation</strong>, w=
hich resides in one of the three stages of an environment. It can be transf=
erred between the stages but it is bound to one environment and can not be =
transferred to an other one. An environment can hold multiple fully functio=
nal deployments (eZ Publish Installations). This implies, that you can have=
 multiple concurrent deployments (installations of eZ Publish) in one envir=
onment. But only one of the deployments is public available for your custom=
ers at a time.</p>
<p>Every time you change a piece of your code (like a template or a style s=
heet) you have to create a new Deployment including the changes to make it =
available to your users. An existing Deployment can't be changed afterwards=
.</p>
<h3 id=3D"IntroductiontotheeZPublishCloud-HowItfitstogether">How It fits to=
gether</h3>
<p>If you create a&nbsp;<span>new deployment it will always reside first in=
 the Staging stage. There can be only one deployment in staging at a time. =
Deployments in Staging can be tested to ensure they work as desired before =
they go Live. As long as the Deployment is in Staging a cache warming can b=
e performed. At the time you move the Deployment to live, the incoming requ=
ests are redirected to the new Deployment, which generates the responses fr=
om now on.</span></p>
<p><span>To create another new&nbsp;deployment you have to push the current=
 staging deployment to the live stage or delete it.</span></p>
<p>The Deployment in the Live stage is the one public available eZ Publish =
installation in your environment. The site accesses configured in this depl=
oyment can be accessed by your customers through the defined URLs. There ca=
n be only one Deployment in the Live stage at a time. If an other deploymen=
t (from Staging or Rollback) is pushed to the Live stage, the current live =
deployment is pushed to the Rollback stage.</p>
<p>The Rollback stage holds deployments which were before in the live stage=
. These deployments can be pushed back to the Live stage, for example if th=
e current Live deployment works not as expected. The Rollback stage can hol=
d multiple deployments at the same time. Deployments in rollback are &quot;=
recycled&quot; (deleted with all its according data) after a time, defined =
in your service contract. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>All deployments in an environment are fully functional ins=
tallations of eZ Publish</strong>&nbsp;and live parallel in your environmen=
t. Each deployment can hold its own database and binary content. All of the=
 the site accesses can be visited via a deployment specific URL. Deployment=
s in Staging and Rollback are protected with basic HTTP authentication to p=
revent public access to the sites of the deployments. (This prevents also u=
nwanted indexing by web crawlers.)</span></p>
<h3 id=3D"IntroductiontotheeZPublishCloud-SharedContent"><span>Shared Conte=
nt</span></h3>
<p><span>In classic eZ Publish installations a one to one relationship exis=
ts between a installation, the database and the &quot;var&quot;-folder for =
binary content like pictures, videos or pdf files. In eZ Publish Cloud we h=
ave opened this relationship. Since every change in the code base leads to =
a new separate Deployment, we provide the possibility to reuse the current =
live Database and its related binary content for a new deployment. This dec=
oupling of content and code enables a transparent upgrade of the code base =
while keeping the actual content of the installation. For a certain time yo=
u have two installations (one in Staging and one in Live) sharing the same =
content.</span></p>
<h2 id=3D"IntroductiontotheeZPublishCloud-DevelopmentProcess">Development P=
rocess</h2>
<p>The eZ Publish Cloud is designed for hosting of eZ Publish installations=
 in production and not for development and testing. Development and testing=
 should happen in separate environments outside of eZ Publish Cloud.</p>
<p>To have a productive, fully functional eZ Publish installation running o=
n our Cloud Service several steps are necessary.</p>
<p><u>Develop your site locally</u>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Setup the full ez Publish installation incl. database on your local des=
ktop or development server.</li>
<li>Apply all the customizations you need to the installation.</li>
<li>Create content or import content on your development system</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are satisfied with your work and it matches all your requirements=
, <u>upload it to your eZ Publish Cloud</u> environment:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a dump of database in your local development environment upload =
the dump to the eZ Publish Cloud</li>
<li>make a tar ball of the content folder under <code>ezpublish/var/</code>=
, upload it to the eZ Publish Cloud</li>
<li>upload your eZ Publish installation (without the <code>var</code> folde=
r) into the git</li>
<li>Tag the git revision to make it available in the Cloud Gui</li>
</ol>
<p>Deploy the Installation in the eZ Publish Cloud (see the UI manual below=
)</p>
