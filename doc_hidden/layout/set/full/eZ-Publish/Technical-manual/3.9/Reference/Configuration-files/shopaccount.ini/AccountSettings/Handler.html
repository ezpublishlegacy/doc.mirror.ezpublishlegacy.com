<h1>Handler</h1>
</div>
<h3>Summary</h3>
Controls which shop account handler that will be used.<h3>Usage</h3>
<pre class="pfix"> <p>Handler=ezuser|ezdefault|ezsimple</p></pre><h3>Description</h3>
 <p>This directive controls how the webshop system will get and store the information about the user when he/she initiates the checkout process. More generally, this directive sets which shop account handler that will be used. A shop account handler is a PHP class providing a mechanism that handles and stores customer information for webshop orders. The system behavior during the checkout process will depend on which shop account handler that is used. The default value of this setting is &quot;ezuser&quot;, which means that users do not need to be logged in when making their orders.</p> <p>There are three built-in shop account handlers called &quot;ezuser&quot;, &quot;ezdefault&quot; and &quot;ezsimple&quot;. These are located in the &quot;kernel/classes/shopaccounthandlers&quot; directory. The following table describes the built-in shop account handlers and how the checkout process behaves when the different handlers are selected.</p> <table class="renderedtable" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">

After that, the &quot;Confirm order&quot; interface will be displayed.</p> <p>Note that if the user is logged in, then some of the fields in the checkout form (e.g. &quot;First Name&quot;) will be automatically pre-filled according to the user's account data (fetched from the content object representing the user).</p> <p>In order to use this shop account handler, you need to make sure that anonymous users are granted access to the &quot;buy&quot; function of the &quot;shop&quot; module.</p>

 <td valign="top" style="vertical-align: top">   <p>When the &quot;Checkout&quot; button is clicked, the system will bring up the &quot;Register account information&quot; form asking the user to provide necessary information for creating a new shop account (name, email and post address of the customer). After that, the &quot;Confirm order&quot; interface will be displayed.</p> <p>Note that logged in users can make orders for other people by providing someone else's contact details in the shop account registration form. The system will not compare the information provided in the registration form with the currently logged in user's actual account data.</p> <p>In order to use this shop account handler, you need to make sure that anonymous users are granted access to the &quot;buy&quot; function of the &quot;shop&quot; module.</p> <p>It is not recommended to use the &quot;ezsimple&quot; handler if you charge different <a href="../../../../Features/VAT-charging-system.html" target="_self">VAT</a> percentage depending on the country the customer lives in. The main reason is that users are not supposed to specify their country while filling the &quot;Register account information&quot; form; and thus the system will not be able to calculate the amount of VAT for users that are not logged in (they will get an error message).</p>
