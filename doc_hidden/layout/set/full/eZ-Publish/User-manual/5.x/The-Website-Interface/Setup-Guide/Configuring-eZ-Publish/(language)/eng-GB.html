<h1>Configuring eZ Publish</h1>
</div>

<p>There are two classes of configuration tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li><div>Simple, site-specific configuration (such as the site logo, standard button labels,etc) performed via the Website Interface</div></li><li><div>Full-featured configuration (such as user management, banner creation, etc)performed via the Administration Interface</div></li>
</ul>
<p>The configuration options available via the Website Interface are the same as the options available in the Administration Interface (in the Design section). In general, this documentation does not describe the Administration Interface functionality. For more information, refer to the <a href="../../../../The-Administration-Interface.html" target="_self">eZ Publish online user manual</a>.</p><p>To view or modify the site settings via the Website Interface, log in to the site as the administrator user you configured during the installation, or with another user account that is a member of the “admin” group. (Refer to the <a href="../../../User-Guide/Managing-User-Accounts.html" target="_self">User Guide</a> for a description of users and groups.) If the default site style is being used, the Login link is located in the top-right corner of any page.</p><a name="eztoc134067_0_1" id="eztoc134067_0_1"></a><h3>Configuring RSS feeds</h3><p>If you want to provide visitors with the ability to subscribe to RSS feeds from your site, you must create an RSS export feed via the Administration Interface. First, log in to the Administration Interface with your “admin” username and password. Next, click on the Setup tab and select RSS from the left navigation menu. A list of existing RSS exports and imports (if any) will be displayed:</p>
<div class="">        <img src="../../../../../../../../../../../var/doc/storage/images/media/images/rss-lists/134071-1-eng-GB/RSS-Lists_reference.jpg" alt="RSS Lists" />
<p>RSS Lists</p>







</div><p>Click on the <b>New export </b>button to create an RSS feed that you can incorporate into the webpages on your site (via the <b>Site settings</b>, described below). An RSS export includes the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><div><b>Name:</b> The name of the feed.</div></li><li><div><b>Description:</b> A short description of the feed.</div></li><li><div><b>Site URL:</b> Enter the base URL of your site (as specified on the <b>Site Details</b> page in the&nbsp;Setup Wizard). This generates the URL links in the export, constructed by combining the <b>Site URL</b> (ie, &quot;<i>http://www.example.com/</i>&quot;) and the path to the individual object (configured in the source, for example &quot;<i>/articles/my_article</i>&quot;). The Site URL varies based on your web server and eZ Publish configuration.</div></li><li><div><b>Image:</b> A thumbnail image representing the RSS feed and / or your web site. The suggested dimensions are 64x64 pixels.</div></li><li><div><b>RSS version:</b> There are currently two versions of the RSS protocol: 1.0 and 2.0. Refer to Wikipedia for more information about RSS: <i>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(file_format)</i>. eZ Publish supports both versions. Choose which format your RSS feed should use. In general, unless you specifically need to support older clients, use version 2.0.</div></li><li><div><b>Number of objects:</b> Specify the number of objects the RSS feed should contain. To avoid performance issues with RSS clients, this number should not be too large (for example, 10- 20).</div></li><li><div><b>Active:</b> Activate and deactivate the RSS feed with this control. If the feed is deactivated but still referenced in the site settings, the user's RSS client will display an eZ Publish kernel error (for example, “kernel (3) / Error, The requested page could not be displayed.(3)”).</div></li><li><div><b>Main node only:</b> If this option is enabled, only changes to the “main” node of an object will be added to the feed. For example, an article may have three “locations” in the content tree. If RSS is enabled for each of those locations, the article will be added to three feeds.If this option is enabled, it will only be added to the RSS feed for the object's “main” location.</div></li><li><div><b>Access URL:</b> This option specifies the URL to this RSS feed.</div></li><li><div><b>Source 1:</b> Each RSS feed can contain multiple source nodes that get added to the RSS feed. By default, the fields for configuring a single source node (<b>Source 1</b>) are displayed.To add additional nodes, click the <b>Add source</b> button. (To delete an existing source from the feed, click on&nbsp;<b>Remove this source</b>.)</div></li>
</ul>
<p>To configure a source, enter data in the fields as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><div><b>Source path:</b> The location in the content tree from where feed items will be collected.</div></li><li><div><b>Sub nodes:</b> Specify whether or not nodes beneath the Source path nodes in the content hierarchy should be included in the feed.</div></li><li><div><b>Class:</b> Specify the content class that should be added to the feed. To specify multiple content classes, click the button Add source, specify the same URL, but specify a different content class.</div></li><li><div><b>Title:</b> Specify the attribute in the content object that will be used as a title for theelement. The most common title attributes are “title”, “name” and “short name”, but other attributes might be preferred for different content classes.</div></li><li><div><b>Description:</b> Specify the attribute in the content object that will be used as a description for the element. The most common description attributes are “short description”, “description” and “summary”, but other attributes might be preferred for different content classes.</div></li>
</ul>
<a name="eztoc134067_0_2" id="eztoc134067_0_2"></a><h3>Editing site settings</h3><p>After you have logged in as a user who is a member of the “Admin” group, you will see a Site settings link in the top-right corner of any page:</p>
<div class="">        <img src="../../../../../../../../../../../var/doc/storage/images/media/images/site-settings-option/134083-1-eng-GB/Site-Settings-Option_reference.jpg" alt="Site Settings Option" />
