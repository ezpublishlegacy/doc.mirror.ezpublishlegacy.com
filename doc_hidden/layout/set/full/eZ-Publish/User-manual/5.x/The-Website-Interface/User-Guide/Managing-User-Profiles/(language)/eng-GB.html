<h1>Managing User Profiles</h1>
</div>

<p>The personal details and account preferences associated with a user account are called the “user profile”. To view or modify your own user profile, use the Website Interface. To view or modify another user's profile, use the Administration Interface.</p><a name="eztoc133828_0_1" id="eztoc133828_0_1"></a><h3>Logging in to the Website Interface</h3><p>To log in to the Website Interface, click on the <b>Login option</b> located in the top of the page.</p><p>Enter your user name and password and then click on the Login button:</p>
<div class="">        <img src="../../../../../../../../../../../var/doc/storage/images/media/images/login-feature/134089-1-eng-GB/Login-Feature_reference.jpg" alt="Login Feature" />
<p>Login Feature</p>







</div><a name="eztoc133828_0_2" id="eztoc133828_0_2"></a><h3>Editing your Profile</h3><p>The Website Interface can be used to modify some of the personal information in your user profile. After logging in, click on the My profile link located (by default) in the top right corner of the page. This&nbsp; will display a page that shows your current settings and contains links to pages where you can configure your preferences (described below). To modify your personal information, click on the Edit profile&nbsp; button.</p>
<div class="">        <img src="../../../../../../../../../../../var/doc/storage/images/media/images/editing-my-profile/134092-1-eng-GB/Editing-My-Profile_reference.jpg" alt="Editing My Profile" />
<p>Editing My Profile</p>







</div><a name="eztoc133828_0_2_1" id="eztoc133828_0_2_1"></a><h4>Editing Language Settings</h4><p>If your site is configured for multiple languages, after clicking the Edit profile button, a page is displayed that allows you to configure the languages related to your user account. eZ Publish can be configured to support multiple languages. (For instruction, refer to the eZ Publish Installation Guide.) The text components of each “object” (a user account, an article, a forum post, an image) can&nbsp; exist in multiple languages. When a site visitor selects a language (from the language list located by default in the top left corner of the page), the text components of objects will subsequently be&nbsp; displayed in the language they selected (if a translation exists in that language).</p><p>For instance, if an article exists in both French and English, a user who has specified “English” as his language will see the English version, while a user who has specified “French” as her language will see the French version. If a user specifies “German” as his language, and no German translation exists for the article, the user will see the article in the site's default language.</p><p>Similar to the article example above, a user's personal information can be published in multiple languages. (This only affects the user's signature and alternative text for their image, not other&nbsp; characteristics such as their first or last name.) As an example of how this is used, a user might enable the French site interface while replying to a forum post written in French. In that case, the&nbsp; French translation of their signature will be appended to their post. If the same user enables the English site while replying to a forum post, the English translation of their signature will be used.</p>

<p>Editing Language Settings</p>







</div><p>The following configuration options are available for language settings:</p>
<ul>
<li><div>Select the language you want to use when editing the object: If multiple&nbsp; languages have been enabled for this user account, they will all be listed here. Click the radio button beside the language that you wish to edit.</div></li><li><div>Select the language you want to add to the object: To add additional languages to the user account, select them from this list. This list shows all the languages that are enabled for your eZ&nbsp; Publish installation.</div></li><li><div>Select the language the added translation will be based on: If you choose a language to base the translation on, then the current content will be displayed on the edit page, as opposed to&nbsp; editing without basing the translation on existing text, where you will see a edit page with all empty attributes. This means you will have to enter all information from scratch (except the&nbsp; attributes that are not translatable).</div></li>
</ul>
<p>When complete, click on the Edit button.</p><a name="eztoc133828_0_2_2" id="eztoc133828_0_2_2"></a><h4>Editing Personal Details</h4><p>After you have selected the desired translation (if multiple languages have been configured for your site), the page containing your personal information will be displayed.</p><p>The following items can be edited:</p>
<ul>
<li><div>First name</div></li><li><div>Last name</div></li><li><div>Password</div></li><li><div>Email address</div></li><li><div>Signature (used in forums)</div></li><li><div>Image (used in forums)</div></li><li><div>Alternative image text (an accessibility standard requirement, but not a mandatory field)</div></li>
</ul>
<p>When complete, click on the Send for Publishing button, to save it, our on Discard button, to go back to the site's main page.</p>
