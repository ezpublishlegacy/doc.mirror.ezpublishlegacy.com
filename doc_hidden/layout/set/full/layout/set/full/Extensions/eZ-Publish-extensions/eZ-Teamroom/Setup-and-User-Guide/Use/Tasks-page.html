<h1>Tasks page</h1>
</div>

 <p>The task page allows teamroom members to easily share project tasks. Users with the necessary rights can post and edit tasks in the to do list of the teamroom. These tasks are automatically added to the common calendar. The task page itself provides an overview of the teamroom related tasks including their progress status (3), priority level (1), planned end date (4) and expected effort (5). </p> <p>The tasks are displayed in a list:</p> 
<div class="object-center">        <img src="../../../../../../../../../../../../var/doc/storage/images/media/images/task_list/108760-1-eng-GB/task_list_doc.jpg" alt="" />








</div> <p>A click on the <b>Info </b>icon (2) of an existing task will show more detailed information, whereas the <b>Edit </b>icon (6) will let a user edit the details of a task. Click on the <b>progress meter</b> (3) to change the current progress of the task. The progress is also displayed in percentile and can additionally be edited through the <b>Edit </b>icon (6). The <b>Trash </b>Icon (7) allows you to delete tasks. By using the <b>Filter </b>link at the bottom of the page, you can toggle between two modes: the finished tasks and the unfinished tasks. Use the links provided to sort tasks or filter by category or keywords. New tasks can be created with the <b>Add new task</b> button.</p> <p>Besides the typical fields such as Title and Description, the Add new task page has some specific fields, as shown in the following screenshot:</p> 
<div class="object-center">        <img src="../../../../../../../../../../../../var/doc/storage/images/media/images/create_a_task_fields/108763-1-eng-GB/create_a_task_fields_doc.jpg" alt="" />








</div> <p>
Use the Progress section to set the percentile of progress that has been made to the task. The estimated effort can be added in either hours or minutes.<br />Use the Milestone drop down list to add the task to an existing milestone. In the Users section, all Teamroom members are listed, so to assign the task to a user simply check the box next to their name. The section Related Documents allows users to add existing blog entries, files, milestones,... and so on to the task. To set the priority of a task, select the level from the drop down list. Possible levels range from 5 (low), 4 (tepid), 3 (normal), 2 (medium) to 1 (high).</p>
