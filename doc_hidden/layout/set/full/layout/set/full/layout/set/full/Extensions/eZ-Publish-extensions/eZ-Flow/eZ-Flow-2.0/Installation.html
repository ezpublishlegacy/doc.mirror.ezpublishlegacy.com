<h1>Installation</h1>
</div>

<p>To install eZ Flow, you must first install the packages on your web server and prepare the database. This process is exactly the same as installing the regular version of eZ Publish.</p><p>First, ensure that your web server meets the <a href="Requirements.html" target="_self">requirements</a>.</p><p>If you are upgrading to eZ Flow 2.x from a previous version please refer to the upgrade notes for <a href="../Upgrading-eZ-Flow/eZ-Flow-9.html" target="_self">2.0</a> and <a href="../Upgrading-eZ-Flow/eZ-Flow-8.html" target="_self">2.1</a>.</p><a name="eztoc108879_0_1" id="eztoc108879_0_1"></a><h3>Installing on Linux/UNIX</h3><p>After checking that your system meets the requirements, install the software according to the instructions located&nbsp;<a href="../../../../eZ-Publish/Technical-manual/4.x/Installation/Normal-installation/Installing-eZ-Publish-on-a-Linux-UNIX-based-system.html" target="_self">here.</a></p><p>In the first step, you will create a database for eZ Publish. Next, you will download, unpack and install the eZ Publish distribution. Follow the instructions until you reach the step that instructs you to start the Setup Wizard. Then proceed to the <a href="Installation.html#wizard" target="_self">Running the Setup Wizard</a> section of this document.</p><a name="eztoc108879_0_2" id="eztoc108879_0_2"></a><h3>Installing on Windows</h3><p>After checking that your system meets the requirements, install the software according to the instructions located <a href="../../../../eZ-Publish/Technical-manual/4.x/Installation/Normal-installation/Installing-eZ-Publish-on-Windows.html" target="_self">here</a>.</p><p>In the first step, you will create a database for eZ Publish. Next, you will download, unpack and install the eZ Publish distribution. Follow the instructions until you reach the step that instructs you to start the Setup Wizard. Then proceed to the <a href="Installation.html#wizard" target="_self">Running the Setup Wizard</a> section of this document.</p><a name="eztoc108879_1" id="eztoc108879_1"></a><h2>Running the Setup Wizard</h2><p>The Website Interface is installed via the regular eZ Publish Setup Wizard. Visit the <a href="../../../../eZ-Publish/Technical-manual/4.x/Installation/The-setup-wizard.html" target="_self">Setup Wizard documentation</a> for more information.</p><p>To initiate the eZ Publish Setup Wizard, browse to the URL <i>http://example.com/index.php</i>, where example.com is the name of the web server where you installed eZ Publish.</p><p>When installing the Website Interface, note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><div><b>Welcome page</b>: The eZ Publish Setup Wizard's Welcome page has a button labeled <b>Finetune</b>. This option should only be used by people with considerable experience at installing eZ Publish. Most people should click the <b>Next</b> button. </div></li><li><div><b>Site package</b>: This page lists all the available site packages from <a href="http://packages.ez.no/4.0/" target="_self">http://packages.ez.no/ezpublish</a>. Select your eZ Publish version and locate the package called <b>eZ Flow</b>, enable the radio button next to it, then click <b>Next</b>. </div></li><li><div><b>Site details</b>: The <b>User path </b>and <b>Admin path</b> fields refer to the siteaccess. A siteaccess is a collection of configuration settings that dictates the appearance and behavior of the website. For example, these settings determine which design to use and what language to display. An eZ Publish installation may contain multiple siteaccesses, one for each language, in addition to a siteaccess for the Administration Interface. </div></li><li><div>Change the <b>Title</b> of the website to the name you want your site to display in browsers, search engine results, etc. </div></li><li><div>The <b>Site URL</b> field only needs to be changed if you intend to move the site to a different location. (Consult the online documentation for instructions if this is the case.) </div></li><li><div>The <b>User path</b> field contains the name of the siteaccess that is used as the default when a visitor accesses the web site. If you selected English as the default language, the default user path will be eng (for example, requests for http://www.example.com will be redirected to http://www.example.com/eng). </div></li><li><div>It is not necessary to specify the <b>Admin path</b>, because an eZ Publish site that uses the Website Interface uses a default admin path (http://www.example.com/ezflow_site_admin/). </div></li><li><div><b>Site administrator</b>: This is the default administrative user for the eZ Publish site. Creating additional accounts (including non-administrative accounts used for daily tasks) is described in the <a href="http://ez.no/doc/ez_publish/technical_manual/4_x/concepts_and_basics/access_control" target="_self">eZ Publish documentation</a>. All user accounts must have a unique email address. Therefore, do not use an email account for the admin user that you intend to use later for your regular user account. </div></li>
</ul>
<a name="eztoc108879_1_2_1" id="eztoc108879_1_2_1"></a><h4><b>Cronjob installation</b></h4><p>The eZ Flow extension requires a cronjob operation to be executed every minute. From your eZ Publish root folder execute the following command:</p><pre class="wordwrap"><span class="line">$ php runcronjobs.php ezflow</span>
</pre><p>Read how to set up <a href="../../../../eZ-Publish/Technical-manual/4.4/Features/Cronjobs.html" target="_self">cronjobs</a> in eZ Publish by clicking the link.</p><a name="eztoc108879_1_3" id="eztoc108879_1_3"></a><h3>Accessing your site</h3><p>To access your web site, enter the URL you configured during the installation. For example, if you specified http://example.com/ as the address of your web site, enter that URL in a browser to access the site.</p><p>Note that it may take longer than usual to access web pages the first time. This is because the system creates a cache for each page that you access. Once the cache is created, accessing the page in the future will be faster.</p><p>To access the Administration Interface for your site, load the URL http://www.example.com/ezflow_site_admin/.</p>
