<h1>Q: How do I build a multi-site installation</h1>
</div>

<p><b>A:</b> In eZ Publish there are options that allow for every type of multi-site architecture, on a single eZ Publish installation, or spanning several.</p><p>Depending on the requirements of the business, it is possible to:</p>
<ul>
<li><div>Implement a site factory for small stand-alone Web sites, and make the deployment of a new Web site fully automated at the push of a button. This might simply deploy a new Web site, with its own full eZ Publish content management system, including a choice of site package system models. This is a common solution used by software providers as a service for Small and Medium Businesses to provide a low-price solution to maintaining an on-line presence.</div></li><li><div>Implement a very large scale galaxy of Web sites that might share some part of their content across a unified database, used for all the Web sites, or by relying on syndication functionalities.</div></li><li><div>Use a single eZ Publish installation, but deploy stand-alone Web sites on top of it, with a dedicated content database and autonomous content management for each access assigned to different teams. This is a common set-up for international corporations that might want to share infrastructure and IT resources, but keep each of its department or daughter companies strictly isolated from a content management point of view.</div></li><li><div>Use a single content database and eZ Publish installation and simply plug each Web site into it at various places in its content tree.</div></li>
</ul>
