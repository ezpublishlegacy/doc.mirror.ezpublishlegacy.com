<h1>BasketCleanup</h1>
</div>
<h3>Summary</h3>
Sets how the shopping baskets for expired and removed sessions are cleaned up.<h3>Usage</h3>
<pre class="pfix"> <p>BasketCleanup=cronjob|pageload</p></pre><h3>Description</h3>
 <p>If a user added some products into his basket and then stopped shopping (e.g. closed his browser window) without initiating the checkout process, the user's session will expire after a while. The eZ Publish session handling, which is based on the <a href="http://php.net/session" target="_self">PHP session functionality</a>, takes care about removing expired sessions from the database. It is also possible to remove sessions (either expired or not) using the &quot;Setup - Sessions&quot; part of the admin interface. </p> <p>If the &quot;BasketCleanup&quot; setting is set to &quot;cronjob&quot; (default), removing a user's session from the database will not delete the shopping basket that was created during this session. These unneeded baskets can be cleaned up periodically by running the &quot;basket_cleanup.php&quot; cronjob.</p> <p>If you specify &quot;BasketCleanup=pageload&quot;, removing a user's session from the database (either automatically by session cleanup or manually by the site administrator) will delete the corresponding shopping basket. The &quot;basket_cleanup.php&quot; cronjob will not do anything. Please note that this configuration is not recommended for sites with many visitors because removing baskets on session cleanup will take a lot of time.</p>
