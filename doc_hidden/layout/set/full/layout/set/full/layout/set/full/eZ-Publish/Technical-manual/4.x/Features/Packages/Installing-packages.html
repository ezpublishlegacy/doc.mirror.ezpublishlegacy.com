</div><p>It is possible to install packages that are located under internal repositories. Note that this is not true for site packages and design packages. When you install a package, the system will create content classes and content objects, apply configuration settings and so on. Please note that from eZ Publish 3.8, information about installed packages is stored in the &quot;ezpackage&quot; table within the database.</p><p>The following subsections explain how to install packages of different types.</p><a name="eztoc86208_1" id="eztoc86208_1"></a><h2>Content class packages</h2><p>The following example demonstrates how to install a content class package.</p>
<ol>
<li><div>
 Go to &quot;Setup - Packages&quot; in your administration interface, select the internal repository containing the package you wish to install and click the &quot;Change repository&quot; button. Find the desired package and click on its name. The system will display the package summary as shown in the following screenshot. <br /> 
<div class="object-center linked">            <a href="../../../../../layout/set/full/eZ-Publish/Technical-manual/4.x/Images/Features/Packages/install_ccpackage_step0.html" target="_self"><img src="../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../var/doc/storage/images/ez_publish/technical_manual/4_0/images/features/packages/install_ccpackage_step0/31711-1-eng-GB/install_ccpackage_step0_doc.png" alt="" /></a>
 <p>The content class package summary.</p>







</div>
 <br /> Click the &quot;Install&quot; button.</div></li><li><div>
 The system starts by showing a list of items that will be created during the package installation (look at the next screenshot). <br />

 <p>The content class package installation wizard, step 2.</p>







</div>
 <br />
 If you wish to replace the existing class with the new one, note that all the content objects of the existing class will be removed as well. Use this option only if you know what you're doing. The remaining options make it possible to skip installing the class or create a new one (in both cases, the existing class and its objects will stay untouched).<br /> After clicking the &quot;Continue&quot; button, the system will install the package and display a summary.</div></li>

(Since handling the class installation conflicts is already described in the previous subsection, let's suppose that no class definitions are included in the package that is being installed.)</p>

 If some of the objects being installed already exist (i.e. there is another object with the same <a href="../../Reference/Objects/ezcontentobject.html" target="_self">remote_id</a>), the system will ask how this installation conflict should be handled (see the screenshot below). <br />
