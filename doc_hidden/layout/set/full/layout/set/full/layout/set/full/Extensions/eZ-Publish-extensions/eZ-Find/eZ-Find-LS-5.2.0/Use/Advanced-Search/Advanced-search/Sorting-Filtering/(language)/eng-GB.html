<h1>Sorting &amp; Filtering</h1>

 <p>Along the main query, the facets, mentioned in Customization, let you drill down into the results and thus offering you a more sophisticated navigation. This drill down navigation is helpful because users often start with a vague idea of what they are looking for or they might use a broad search phrase. The results from the initial search are returned in relevant categories and show how many search results there are from each of those categories. By clicking on the links for the categories, the search is filtered and narrowed so that users can drill down to pinpoint exactly what they need. The available categories can be customized based on the logical structure of the site content. </p>
