<h1>Q: What license options are available for eZ Publish?</h1>
</div>

<p class=" text-left">A: The following proprietary license options are available for eZ Publish:</p><p class=" text-left"><a href="http://ez.no/Resources/Software/Licenses/GNU-General-Public-License-GPL-2.0" target="_self"><b>GNU General Public License (GPL)</b></a>: eZ Publish is first and foremost available under the GNU General Public License terms. The GPL is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.</p><p class=" text-left">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p><p><a href="http://ez.no/Resources/Software/Licenses/eZ-Proprietary-Use-License-eZ-PUL-Agreement-Version-1.0" target="_self"><b>eZ Proprietary Use License (eZPUL):</b></a> The eZ Proprietary Use License (&quot;eZPUL&quot;) is a traditional for-pay, proprietary license for an end user (&quot;you&quot;) of eZ Publish. The license allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li><div>run eZ Publish</div></li><li><div>modify eZ Publish for your own use and, if desired, share your modifications with others under the following conditions:
<ul>
<li><div>you may only run a single eZ Publish-powered website per eZPUL license</div></li><li><div>If you share your modifications to eZ Publish, you may only distribute your modifications under a valid license provided or approved by eZ Systems.</div></li>
</ul>
</div></li>
</ul>
<p>The eZPUL license is only available, as an option, for eZ Publish Enterprise subscribers. Renewal is needed to get new versions of the software and continued software guarantee.</p><p><b>eZPEL:</b> The eZ Proprietary Extension License (&quot;eZPEL&quot;) allows software vendors to sell proprietary extensions for eZ Publish. Extensions distributed under the eZPEL may be used with both GPL and non-GPL licensed copies of eZ Publish. Extensions may include up to 100 kilobytes of eZ Publish code. Vendors distributing products under the eZPEL retain full ownership to of their code and are free to add their licensing terms to the product, as long as these terms do not conflict with the terms and conditions of eZPEL.</p><p>The eZPEL license is available for partners providing and selling their Applications on the XTEND market place, willing not to use the GPL licensing model.</p><p>
<a href="http://ez.no/Resources/Software/Licenses/eZ-Business-Use-License-Agreement-eZ-BUL-Version-2.0" target="_self"><b>eZ BUL - eZ Business Use License Agreement (eZ BUL) Version 2.0:</b></a> &quot;Licensed Software&quot; means the eZ Publish Enterprise Edition content management system or other software product downloaded, ordered or otherwise legally acquired (licensed) by Licensee from Licensor (or other party authorized by the Licensor). &quot;Licensed Copy&quot; means one sample of the Licensed Software.<br />&quot;Website&quot; means up to three defined site access configurations (unique URLs) that may for instance consist of one site for public use, one site for internal use (such as an intranet) and one site for site administrator use, communicated via an unlimited number of channels (such as traditional web or mobile device).</p><p><a href="http://ez.no/Resources/Software/Licenses/eZ-Trial-and-Test-License-Agreement-eZ-TTL-v2.0" target="_self"><b>eZ Trial and Test License Agreement (eZ TTL) v2.0:</b></a> This license agreement is entered into in connection with Licenseeís participation in testing a new version of Licensor software and is valid for 6 months from the date the software was acquired (downloaded).</p><p><a href="http://ez.no/Resources/Software/Licenses/New-Berkeley-Software-Distribution-License-New-BSD" target="_self"><b>New Berkeley Software Distribution License (New BSD):</b></a> The New BSD license is used for the eZ Components to provide the largest amount of freedom for developers that want to base their application on this product.</p>
