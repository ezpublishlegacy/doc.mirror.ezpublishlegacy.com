<h1>Q: How do you implement a multi-country, multi-lingual portal?</h1>
</div>

<p>A: In eZ Publish it is possible to configure site accesses for both countries and languages. One site can be multi-lingual, while one language might span several sites. Define your localization strategy, and it will be possible to implement whatever the outcome.</p><p>Take the example of a multi-country portal, with one Web site per country. All the sites of the portal would share graphical guidelines, features, and content. Some of the sites might share languages, Canada and the United States, for example, and it might be necessary that the Canada site also be itself a multi-lingual site with French and English translations of all the content.</p><p>You may want to display content in the default language when it is not available in the user language, or you might simply want to hide it to the specific user—a simple matter of choice.</p><p>Whether you could manage all content in the same language in a global way, reducing your workload, or adapt and finetune for each specific country, is also a simple matter of settings and content localization architecture!</p>
