No engineering team is perfect though, and if you do discover a security issue in one of our products we are very grateful for your help in reporting it to us privately, and refraining from public disclosure until we have found the solution and distributed it. Thank you!</p><a name="eztoc137363_1_1" id="eztoc137363_1_1"></a><h3>Channels</h3>

If you know, also include what type of security issue it is (example: SQL injection, CSRF, role/policy failure), what the nature of it is (example: slowing/stopping a web site, leaking sensitive information, destroying data, privilege escalation) and how easy it is to exploit (example: Does it require editor login?).</div></li>
</ul>
<a name="eztoc137363_1_3" id="eztoc137363_1_3"></a><h3>Dialogue</h3><p>The engineering team may need your help to clarify certain specifics, so please respond to such inquiries. We will keep you updated about the progress on our end.</p><a name="eztoc137363_1_4" id="eztoc137363_1_4"></a><h3>Responsible disclosure</h3><p>Please give the engineering team time to produce and distribute a solution before you disclose the issue on other channels, if you plan to do so.
