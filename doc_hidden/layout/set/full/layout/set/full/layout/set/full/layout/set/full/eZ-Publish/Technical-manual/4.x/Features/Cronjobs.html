</div><p>Some features of eZ Publish depend on a maintenance script that takes care of various tasks behind the scenes. This script is located in the root of the eZ Publish directory and should be executed at regular intervals. The script is called &quot;runcronjobs.php&quot;. Among other things, it processes <a href="../Concepts-and-basics/Workflows.html" target="_self">workflows</a>, checks / validates URLs, sends out notification e-mails, etc. Although eZ Publish works without a periodical execution of &quot;runcronjobs.php&quot;, it is still recommended to have it running in the background. Some features, for example the <a href="Notifications.html" target="_self">notification system</a>, will not work if the script is not running.</p><p>The most common practice is to instruct the operating system to automatically run the script every 30-60 minutes. However, some tasks should be executed more frequently than others and thus it is a good idea to divide the cronjobs into groups/sets and run them separately. Please refer to the &quot;<a href="Cronjobs/Configuring-cronjobs.html" target="_self">Configuring cronjobs</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="Cronjobs/Running-cronjobs.html" target="_self">Running cronjobs</a>&quot; sections for further details.</p>
