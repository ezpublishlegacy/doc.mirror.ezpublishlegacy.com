<h3>Summary</h3>
Sets WebDAV functionality.<h3>Usage</h3>
<pre class="pfix"><p>EnableWebDAV<b>=</b>true |<b>&nbsp;</b><b>false</b></p></pre><h3>Description</h3>
<p>This setting allows you to enable or disable WebDAV support. WebDAV is an abbreviation for &quot;Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning&quot; and is a set of extensions to the HTTP protocol which allows users to collaboratively edit and manage files on a web server. This is achieved by making use of a WebDAV compatible client / application.</p><p>Using a WebDAV compatible client, the user connects to the server and is able to browse and manage files in a similar way as with a network share or an FTP server. In other words, what this protocol does is that it makes it possible to browse, create, remove, upload, download, rename, etc. files and directories on a web server. One of the most important advantages of this technology is that it uses port 80 for network traffic. This means that if you are able to surf the site from your workstation, you can also use WebDAV to administer it. It does not require firewall reconfiguration.</p><p>From version 3.2 and up, eZ Publish provides a built in WebDAV server. This implementation allows users to communicate with eZ Publish using a WebDAV compatible client. Once connected, it is possible to browse and manage the node tree of a site. The tree will be displayed as if it were a file system (as directories and files). When enabling WebDAV additional settings must be set in site.ini and upload.ini. For more information on WebDAV please visit <a href="http://ez.no/doc/ez_publish/ technical_manual/4_4/features/webdav" target="_self">http://ez.no/doc/ez_publish/ technical_manual/4_4/features/webdav</a></p><p>By default this function is disabled (&quot;false&quot;).</p><p>This setting is case sensitive</p><h3>Examples</h3>
<pre class="wordwrap"><span class="line">EnableWebDAV=false</span>
</pre><p>This is the default setting.</p>
