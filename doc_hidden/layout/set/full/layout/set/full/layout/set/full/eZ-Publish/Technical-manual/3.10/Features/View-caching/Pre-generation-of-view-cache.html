<h1>Pre-generation of view cache</h1>
</div>

 <p>The &quot;cache on request&quot; approach described in the previous sections supposes that the view cache for a page is created when this page is being accessed for the first time. The additional &quot;cache on publishing&quot; functionality makes it possible to generate view cache files when a node is being created or modified. This makes the publishing process a bit slower (not recommended for sites with lots of content editors), but reduces the access time when the pages are being requested.</p> <p>The &quot;cache on publishing&quot; feature is disabled by default. This behavior is controlled by the <a href="../../Reference/Configuration-files/site.ini/ContentSettings/PreViewCache.html" target="_self">PreViewCache</a> setting located under the &quot;[ContentSettings]&quot; section of the &quot;site.ini&quot; configuration file. Please note that enabling this feature will only affect the view caches generated for the &quot;full&quot; view mode. Whenever an object is published, the system will generate the view cache for all the nodes/locations of this object and their parent nodes. The <a href="../../Reference/Configuration-files/site.ini/ContentSettings/PreCacheSiteaccessArray.html" target="_self">PreCacheSiteaccessArray</a> setting located at the same place controls which siteaccess(es) the view cache should be generated for (usually public siteaccesses that are used for viewing content).</p> <p>If you wish to create the view cache files on publishing, add the following lines to the &quot;[ContentSettings]&quot; section of &quot;settings/siteaccess/example_admin/site.ini.append.php&quot; configuration file (replace &quot;example_admin&quot; by the name of the siteaccess that is used for creating and editing content): </p><pre class="wordwrap"><span class="line">PreViewCache=enabled</span>
<span class="line">PreCacheSiteaccessArray[]</span>
<span class="line">PreCacheSiteaccessArray[]=example</span>
</pre><p>This will enable the &quot;cache on publishing&quot; feature and tell the system that the view cache should be generated for the &quot;example&quot; siteaccess. If you have a news folder containing a lot of articles, editing one of them will lead to re-generating the view cache files of the article itself and its parent (the news folder). When a new article is published in the folder, the system will generate a view cache for the newly added article and re-generate the view cache of the news folder.</p> <p>Please note that the view cache will only be generated for the Anonymous user by default. This behavior is controlled by the <a href="../../Reference/Configuration-files/site.ini/ContentSettings/PreviewCacheUsers.html" target="_self">PreviewCacheUsers</a> setting located in the &quot;[ContentSettings]&quot; section of the &quot;site.ini&quot; configuration file.</p>
