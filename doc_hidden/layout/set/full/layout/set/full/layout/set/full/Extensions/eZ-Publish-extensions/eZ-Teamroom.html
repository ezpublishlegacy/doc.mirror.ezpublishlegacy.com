 <p>eZ Teamroom is an eZ Publish extension that makes teamwork simple. As a powerful collaborative tool it is designed to support teams in planning and executing their projects. Unlike most project management instruments eZ Teamroom particularly focuses on the availability of exchanging and sharing project information at any time. By building on the experiences made from Web 2.0 in supporting communities, knowledge bases like e.g. Wiki or forums and journals, eZ Teamroom encourages team members to share and interact.</p> <p>As a project management tool, eZ Teamroom allows you to plan, manage and control projects. You can easily plan and document milestones and tasks, organize schedules, calendars and events. Also each user has his own unique and personal space which only displays what he needs or is allowed to see. By allowing team members to share and discuss all types of information communication is optimized. </p> <p>An added bonus is that by directly involving all project members in the process of planning and information exchange, eZ Teamroom aids the development of a stronger identification towards the &quot;managed&quot; project and as such contributes to creating a team identity. </p>  <a name="eztoc107502_1" id="eztoc107502_1"></a><h2>Documentation:</h2> <p><a href="eZ-Teamroom/Setup-and-User-Guide.html" target="_self">Setup and user guide</a> </p>
