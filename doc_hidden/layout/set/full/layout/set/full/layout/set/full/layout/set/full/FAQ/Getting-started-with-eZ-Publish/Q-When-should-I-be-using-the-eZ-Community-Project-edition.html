<h1>Q: When should I be using the eZ Community Project edition?</h1>
</div>

<p>A: You should be part of the community project edition when your concern is the development of the eZ Publish software, either as an individual programmer or an active eZ System partner. You can also consider using the community edition software when you are able to provide your installation and users of eZ Publish with the necessary level of support and maintenance services.&nbsp;</p><p>
The global eZ Community Program reflects eZ Systems dedicated care towards its community, and the eZ Ecosystem's core philosophy: Open, Share, Innovate. By being open, sharing ideas and experiences together, we believe we can achieve greater things.<br />This program is designed to accelerate collaboration between eZ and Community Members to reach lots of great successes for all parties involved. It calls for all members of the eZ Ecosystem to participate to a steady growth, attraction, openness, helpfulness, exchange, innovation, intensity and fun increase, making this community the right place to step by when working with eZ Software.</p>
