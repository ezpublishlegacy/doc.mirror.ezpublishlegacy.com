<h1>Previewing content</h1>
</div>

 <p>The <a href="../The-administration-interface/The-object-edit-interface.html" target="_self">object edit interface</a> makes it possible to preview content before it is published. This means that you can for example generate a real preview of an article while you're typing it up. There is no need to publish it first in order to view it. The preview feature can be reached from both the edit and the version management interface. In the edit interface it can be accessed by clicking the &quot;View&quot; button, in the version management interface you can click on the different version numbers and translations. The following image shows how the preview interface looks like.</p> 
<div class="object-center">        <img src="../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../var/doc/storage/images/ez_publish/user_manual/3_9/images/preview/30333-2-eng-GB/preview_doc.png" alt="The preview interface." />
 <p>The preview interface.</p>







</div> <p>Please note that it is possible to generate a preview without the administration interface around it. This can be done by clicking on the icon with red arrows in its corners, it is located at the top of the preview window.</p>  <a name="eztoc71770_1" id="eztoc71770_1"></a><h2>Previewing the object which is being edited</h2>
