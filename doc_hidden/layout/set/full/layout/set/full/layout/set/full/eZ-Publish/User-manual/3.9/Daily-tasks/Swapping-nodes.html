<h1>Swapping nodes</h1>
</div>

 <p>The administration interface makes it possible to swap (replace) a certain node (page) with another one. Please note that this feature is considered to be advanced functionality. It is typically useful when you wish to change the type of a node but keep the structure which is below it. For example, there might be a situation where you wish to replace a folder that contains several news articles (or even a complex hierarchy) with a different type of node (for example a special kind of folder).</p> <p>This feature is also useful when there is a need to change one of the top level nodes (Content, Media, User). In eZ Publish, a top level node can not be removed from the system, but it may be swapped/replaced with another node. For example, if you want to use a news article instead of a folder (which is the default) as the top level node, you could simply swap the folder with an existing article node. The following text explains how you can swap a node with another one.</p> 
<ol>
 <li><div> Navigate the tree until you find the node that you wish to replace with another node. </div></li> <li><div> Click on the node's icon in order to bring up the context menu. </div></li> <li><div> Select the &quot;Swap with another node&quot; item from the &quot;Advanced&quot; submenu, the browse interface will be displayed. </div></li> <li><div> Use the browse interface to locate the node that should be used instead of the one you found in step 1. </div></li> <li><div> Click OK - the target node will then be swapped with the one you selected using the browse interface. </div></li> 
</ol>
