<h3>Summary</h3>
Makes it possible to have the contents of objects be approved by an editor.<h3>Description</h3>
 <p>This event makes it possible to have the contents of objects be approved by an editor before they are actually published. A workflow using this event must be connected to the &quot;content/publish/before&quot; trigger. The following screenshot shows the edit interface for this event.</p> 
<div class="object-center">        <img src="../../../../../../../../../../../../var/doc/storage/images/ez_publish/technical_manual/3_10/images/reference/workflow_events/edit_interface_approve/9425-1-eng-GB/edit_interface_approve_doc.png" alt="Edit interface for the &quot;Approve&quot; event." />
 <p>Edit interface for the &quot;Approve&quot; event.</p>







</div>    <a name="eztoc79851_0_0_1" id="eztoc79851_0_0_1"></a><h4>Affected sections</h4> <p>The &quot;Affected sections&quot; menu shows the <a href="../../Concepts-and-basics/Content-management/Sections.html" target="_self">sections</a> that are available on the system. It allows the administrator to filter objects that belong to specific sections. Only objects that belong to the selected sections will be affected by the event.</p>       <a name="eztoc79851_0_0_2" id="eztoc79851_0_0_2"></a><h4>User who approves content</h4> <p>The &quot;User who approves content&quot; menu shows a list of the user accounts on the system. It allows the administrator to select which user(s) that should function as editors and thus have the power to approve or deny content.</p>       <a name="eztoc79851_0_0_3" id="eztoc79851_0_0_3"></a><h4>Excluded users and groups</h4> <p>The &quot;Excluded users and groups&quot; menu allows the administrator to select users and user groups that should not be affected by the event. In other words, if one of the selected users or a user who is a member of a selected group publishes an object that normally would be affected by this event, it will not be affected.</p> <p>This event makes use of the collaboration feature of eZ publish. A user's pending items (items waiting for approval) will be displayed under &quot;Pending items&quot; within the &quot;My account&quot; part of the administration interface. The &quot;Collaboration&quot; interface under &quot;My account&quot; provides the review/approve/reject interface for the editors.</p> <p>Please note that the &quot;cronjobs/workflow.php&quot; cronjob must be run periodically for this to work.</p>
