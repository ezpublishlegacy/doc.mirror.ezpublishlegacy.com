<h3>Summary</h3>
Provides a view that generates an E-mail containing the data that was posted (DEPRECATED).
<h3>Description</h3>
 <p>This module has been deprecated and should not be used. It is strongly recommended to use the <a href="../../Concepts-and-basics/Content-management/Information-collection.html" target="_self">information collection</a> feature instead.</p> <p>This module is one of the simplest modules in eZ Publish. It only contains one view, which is the &quot;process&quot; view. This view can only be called using HTTP POST (form action). The process view simply sends out an e-mail containing the data that was posted using the input fields. This module does not act as an interface to an engine inside the eZ Publish kernel. It only provides a simple form processing mechanism. </p> <p>Note that the view provided by this module is insecure by design. It is possible to specify the sender's and the receiver's E-mail address using certain hidden input fields. In other words, it can be easily exploited by spammers. That's why this module is disabled by default. It can be enabled by setting &quot;Module=enabled&quot; in the [FormProcessSettings] block within an configuration override file for &quot;site.ini&quot;. Hint: by commenting out the sender/receiver lines within the switch statement in &quot;/kernel/form/process.php&quot; it is possible to make this module much more secure than it is by default. </p> <p> <h2><a href="form/Views.html">Views</a></h2>
