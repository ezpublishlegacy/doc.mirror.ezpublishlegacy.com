<h1>Publishing objects asynchronously</h1>
</div>

<p>When you have enabled &quot;Asynchronous publishing&quot; in &quot;content.ini&quot; and started the daemon, the system will handle your publishing requests as described below.</p><p>When you have edited your object in the &quot;Object edit interface&quot; and pressed &quot;Send for publishing&quot;, the request to publish the object is queued. This queue is database based and monitored by the daemon, &quot;ezasynchronouspublisher&quot;, to know what operations are to be performed. On your screen you can follow the status of the publishing process.</p><p>You will get a message confirming the publishing: &quot;Your content is being published&quot; and then presented with the current status of the queued item. There are three status types:</p>
<ul>
<li><div>Pending - The publishing request is now in a queue of publishing requests</div></li><li><div>Working - The request is processed to find a queue of publishing request and a place in the queue</div></li><li><div>Published - The publishing request has been processed and your object is published</div></li>
</ul>
<p>If something irregular happens in the publishing process the system will issue error messages according to the situation.</p>
