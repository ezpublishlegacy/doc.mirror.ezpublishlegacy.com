<div class="attribute-heading">
<h1>Managing users</h1>
</div>

 <p>The &quot;User accounts&quot; tab allows you to manage the users and user groups that have been added to the system. In eZ Publish users and groups are managed in a similar way as if they were on a filesystem. Users can be put into groups and groups can contain other groups. The following screenshot shows what the administration interface looks like when you select the &quot;User accounts&quot; tab.</p> 
<div class="object-center linked">            <a href="../../../../layout/set/full/eZ-Publish/User-manual/3.9/Images/User-accounts-tab.html" target="_self"><img src="../../../../../../../../../../../var/doc/storage/images/ez_publish/user_manual/3_9/images/user_accounts_tab/15040-2-eng-GB/user_accounts_tab_doc.png" alt="The &quot;User accounts&quot; tab." /></a>
 <p>The &quot;User accounts&quot; tab.</p>







</div> <p>The following text explains how you can carry out daily tasks related to users on the system.</p>  <a name="eztoc71752_1" id="eztoc71752_1"></a><h2>Adding a new user group</h2> <p>You can add new user groups in the same way as you add other content (articles, folders, etc.).</p>
<ol>
 <li><div> Click the &quot;User accounts&quot; tab. </div></li> <li><div> Navigate the node tree until you find the location where you wish to add the new user group. </div></li> <li><div> Select &quot;User group&quot; from the dropdown in the &quot;Sub items&quot; window and click the &quot;Create here&quot; button. The object edit interface will be displayed. </div></li> <li><div> Fill in the necessary information (name and description) and click the &quot;Send for publishing&quot; button. The user group will be published at the selected location. You can then go ahead and add new users and/or additional groups to this group. </div></li> 
</ol>
   <a name="eztoc71752_2" id="eztoc71752_2"></a><h2>Adding new user accounts</h2> <p>You can add new users in the same way as you add other content (articles, folders, etc.).</p>
<ol>
 <li><div> Click the &quot;User accounts&quot; tab. </div></li> <li><div> Navigate the node tree until you find the location (typically a user group) where you wish to add the new user. </div></li> <li><div> Select &quot;User account&quot; from the dropdown in the &quot;Sub items&quot; window and click the &quot;Create here&quot; button. The object edit interface will be displayed. </div></li> <li><div> Fill in the necessary information (E-mail, username, password, etc.). </div></li> <li><div> Click the &quot;Send for publishing&quot; button - the user will be published at the selected location. </div></li> 
</ol>
 <p>Please note that a newly created user might not be able to log in and/or access information on the site. This is controlled by the <i>roles</i> that are assigned to the user or the group that the user is a member of. For example, a user put into the &quot;Administrator Users&quot; group will have unlimited access to all functions on the system. You can modify and assign roles using the interface which can be reached by clicking on the &quot;Roles and policies&quot; link located below the user tree.</p>   <a name="eztoc71752_3" id="eztoc71752_3"></a><h2>Changing a user's details</h2> <p>You can change a user's E-mail, password, etc. by editing the node that represents the user. In other words, you can change the user's details in the same way as when you for example change the contents of a news article.</p>
<ol>
 <li><div> Click the &quot;User accounts&quot; tab. </div></li> <li><div> Find the node that represents the user that you want to change by navigating the node tree. </div></li> <li><div> Edit the user in the same way as you would edit a folder, article, etc. </div></li> <li><div> Use the edit interface to make the changes and click the &quot;Send for publishing&quot; button. </div></li> 
</ol>
   <a name="eztoc71752_4" id="eztoc71752_4"></a><h2>Enabling and disabling users </h2> <p>A user account can be enabled or disabled. A disabled user account can not be used to log into the system. It is recommended to disable users instead of deleting them in order to keep existing relations. The following text explains how you can enable/disable a user account.</p> 
<ol>
 <li><div> Click the &quot;User accounts&quot; tab. </div></li> <li><div> Find the user account that you wish to enable/disable by navigating the node tree. </div></li> <li><div> Make sure that the user is displayed in the main area (it must be the object that is currently being viewed). </div></li> <li><div> In the preview window, locate and click the &quot;Configure user account settings&quot; link. The system will bring up the &quot;User settings&quot; interface. </div></li> <li><div> Use the interface to enable/disable the user and click the &quot;OK&quot; button to finish. </div></li> 
</ol>
 
<div class="object-center">        <img src="../../../../../../../../../../../var/doc/storage/images/ez_publish/user_manual/3_9/images/enabling_and_disabling_user_accounts/95730-1-eng-GB/enabling_and_disabling_user_accounts_doc.png" alt="Enabling and disabling user accounts" />
 <p>Enabling and disabling user accounts</p>







</div> <p> <a name="unlocking_user_accounts"></a>
 </p>   <a name="eztoc71752_5" id="eztoc71752_5"></a><h2>Unlocking user accounts</h2> <p>If the <a href="../../../Technical-manual/3.9/Reference/Configuration-files/site.ini/UserSettings/MaxNumberOfFailedLogin.html" target="_self">maximum number of failed login attempts</a> is exceeded, a user account is automatically locked by the system. The user will not be allowed to log in until the account has been unlocked by another user with administrator privileges. The following text explains how user accounts can be unlocked.</p> 
<ol>
 <li><div> Click the &quot;User accounts&quot; tab. </div></li> <li><div> Find the user account that you wish to unlock by navigating the node tree. </div></li> <li><div> Make sure that the user is displayed in the main area (it must be the object that is currently being viewed). </div></li> <li><div> In the preview window, locate and click the &quot;Configure user account settings&quot; link. The system will bring up the &quot;User settings&quot; interface. </div></li> <li><div> Click the &quot;Reset&quot; button. The number of failed login attempts for this user will be reset to zero and the account will be unlocked. Click &quot;OK&quot;. </div></li> 
</ol>

 <p>Unlocking user accounts</p>







</div> <p>The &quot;User settings&quot; interface can also be accessed by requesting &quot;/user/setting/&lt;user_id&gt;&quot; in the URL, where &lt;user_id&gt; is the ID number of the user account that needs to be unlocked.</p>
