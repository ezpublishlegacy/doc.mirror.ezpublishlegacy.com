<h1>The Administration Interface</h1>
</div>

<p>The purpose of this chapter is to present a walk-through of the most commonly used parts of the administration interface that comes with eZ Publish. Please note that the administration interface consists of many parts. This chapter does not cover advanced topics, instead it focuses on the parts that are most likely to be used by people who simply want to manage content.</p><a name="eztoc131403_1" id="eztoc131403_1"></a><h2>Introduction</h2><p>eZ Publish comes with a web based administration interface that makes the everyday tasks of site and content management an easy matter. The interface can be reached and used regardless of location and/or operating environment as long the following requirements are fulfilled:</p>
<ul>
<li><div>&nbsp;The client must be able to reach the eZ Publish server through a network </div></li><li><div>&nbsp;The client must be equipped with a modern/supported web browser </div></li>
</ul>
<p>The administration interface is implemented using the XHTML 1.0 Transitional standard combined with Cascading Stylesheets. In addition, JavaScript (a technology that goes beyond the limitations of (X)HTML) is used in order to create a more friendly environment. However, support for JavaScript on the client side is not required. If JavaScript is unavailable, the administration interface will automatically fallback to static HTML pages with alternate solutions and thus it will function correctly in non-JavaScript browsers.</p><p>For supported browsers see&nbsp;<a href="../../../../Technical-manual/5.x/Installation/Requirements.html" target="_self">Requirements</a>.</p>
