<h1>Filtergroups</h1>
</div>

<a name="eztoc129708_1" id="eztoc129708_1"></a><h2>Filtergroups</h2><p>The Filtergroups are predefined within the eZ odoscope Extension.</p><p><i><b>Note:</b> The number of Filtergroups is not limited, and can be extended. Please, consult eZ Systems in order to know how to extend them.</i></p><p>The Filtergropus represent the most common variants used in web analysis, such as:</p>
<div class="">        <img src="../../../../../../../../../../../var/doc/storage/images/media/images/ez-odoscope-filtergroups4/129940-1-eng-GB/eZ-odoscope-Filtergroups_reference.jpg" alt="eZ odoscope Filtergroups" />
<p>eZ odoscope Filtergroups</p>







</div><p>All Filtergroups refer to visitors' (i.e.: Pages Accessed by the visitors, Operating System the visitors used to access your website, where - Origin - are your visitors from, and so on), and they give you a clear insight about visitors behavior on your web site, between other important information. Combined with <i><a href="../../Usergroups.html" target="_self">Usergroups</a></i>, <a href="../../Keyfigures.html" target="_self">Keyfigures</a> and the Time Period (see the <a href="../../../The-Dashboard/The-Calendar.html" target="_self">Calendar</a>), they are a powerful tool for web site analysis.</p><p>All Filtergroups are in correlation between each other, i.e.: A visit has exact one value in every filtergroup. ‘Not set’ is also a value – meaning that this visit has no data entry in this filtergroup. That said,&nbsp;the <b>main filtergroups</b> must be <b>all checked</b> , so you are able to have data displayed on your charts/reports.Then you can select/deselect the <b>filters</b> (not the filtergroups) you want to use use on them.</p><p>When you create a new Report (or at any time you want to change the information on a report/chart), you must select a <b>main filtergroup</b> (the main filtergroup is the filtergroup which data you want to analyze on your chart/report, i.e.: Session Time, Day of The Week, Browser, Origin, etc). You can do this by right clicking on your report's chart, then clicking on &quot;Data&quot; and finally clicking on &quot;Filtergroups&quot;. You will see a list of the Filtergroups available and then you will be able to select the <b>main filtergroup</b>. Please, refer to the <a href="../../../The-Report.html" target="_self">Report</a> documentation, <b>&quot;Selecting a Filtergroup&quot;</b>, in order to be familiar with this procedure.</p><p><i><b>&nbsp;</b></i>You can select the filters for your chart/report with the odoscope Explorer. Let's see how to do this.</p><p>A Filtergroup has several filters, and can have many levels (hierarchies). A good example is the 'Origin' filtergroup:</p>
<div class="">        <img src="../../../../../../../../../../../var/doc/storage/images/media/images/ez-odoscope-filtergroups-hierarchy2/129832-1-eng-GB/eZ-odoscope-Filtergroups-Hierarchy_reference.jpg" alt="eZ odoscope Filtergroups Hierarchy" />
<p>eZ odoscope Filtergroups Hierarchy</p>







</div><p>As you can see, there are the following levels for Origin:</p>
<ul>
<li><div>Region (Continent)</div></li><li><div>Country</div></li><li><div>County (Province, State)</div></li><li><div>City</div></li>
</ul>
<p>Each level is a filter itself. In the example above, you can see that the final level for the Origin filtergroup is the filter <b>City</b>. This means you can filter from which city your visitors' come from.</p><p>You can also see some very helpful information regarding <b>filters</b>, in the odoscope Explorer area:&nbsp;</p>
<div class="">        <img src="../../../../../../../../../../../var/doc/storage/images/media/images/ez-odoscope-filtergroups-info2/129835-1-eng-GB/eZ-odoscope-Filtergroups-Info_reference.jpg" alt="eZ odoscope Filtergroups Info" />
<p>eZ odoscope Filtergroups Info</p>







</div><p>Let's see what each one means:</p>
<ul>
<li><div><b>Label:</b> The label is the name of the filter (or Filtergroup). You cannot modify this information;</div></li><li><div><b>Visits:</b> On this column you will see the relative number of visits that matches the filter <b>for the level you are looking at</b>, in the time period selected;</div></li><li><div><b>%:</b> On this column you will see the percentage of visits calculated for a filter, regarding the overall amount of visits for all filters of the same level; </div></li>
</ul>
<p><i><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Example: </b>Imagine you have a total number of 1000 visits from Germany, and a total number of 9000 visits from all other European countries. You should see 10%, on this column, for Germany, as the total number of visits from Europe is 10000, and 1000 is 10% of 10000. </i></p>
<ul>
<li><div><b>'Bouncer' (%):</b> On this column you will see the percentage of the keyfigure you are using. The keyfigure is explained in a separate documentation page. Refer to the following link in order to be familiar with it: <a href="../../Keyfigures.html" target="_self">Keyfigures</a>.</div></li>
</ul>
<p>You can go deeper in the levels and select/deselect the filters you want to apply to your chart(s)/report(s).</p><p>You can perform the following actions, regarding Filtergroups and filters:</p>
<ul>
<li><div><b>Expand:</b> Click on the arrow shown at the left of the Filtergroup/filter name to expand it. When you do this, you will be able to see the next level available;<b>&nbsp;</b></div></li><li><div><b>Select/Deselect: </b>Click on Filtergroup/filter to select/deselect it. <i>All <b>under the filter you have selected</b> will be selected/deselected</i>;</div></li><li><div><b>Select a Unique Filter:</b> You can select a <b>unique filter</b> by <i><b>SHIFT</b><b>-clicking</b></i> on the filter you want to select.This will select ONLY the filter you Shift-clicked on, and deselect all the other filters in the same level. <i><b>Note:</b> This action cannot be performed at the Filgregroups level</i>;</div></li><li><div><b>Select Multiple Filters:</b> You can select multiple Filtergroups/filters by <i><b>clicking</b></i> on the Filtergroup(s)/filter(s) you want to select. <i><b>&nbsp;</b></i></div></li>
</ul>
<p><i><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note:</b> You have to deselect all the filters, <b>by clicking on their superior level</b>, so you can select only the filters you want. i.e.: If you want to select only the countries Germany, UK and France, within the filter Europe, you have to do the following:</i></p>
<ul>
<li><div><b>Expand</b> the <b>Origin</b> Filtergroup;</div></li><li><div><b>Deselect</b> the filter <b>Europe</b>;</div></li><li><div><b>Click</b> on the filters: <b>Germany</b>, <b>United Kingdom</b> and <b>France</b>.</div></li>
</ul>
<p><i><b>&nbsp;</b></i>Let's take a look at the eZ odoscope Explorer Signaling:</p>
<div class="">        <img src="../../../../../../../../../../../var/doc/storage/images/media/images/ez-odoscope-explorer-signaling/129838-1-eng-GB/eZ-odoscope-Explorer-Signaling_reference.jpg" alt="eZ odoscope Explorer Signaling" />
<p>eZ odoscope Explorer Signaling</p>







</div>
<ul>
<li><div><b>Empty Square:</b> The filter is not selected;</div></li><li><div><b>Square with a Trace:</b> The filter is partially selected;</div></li><li><div><b>Checked Square:</b> The filter is totally selected.</div></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Hint:</b> If you look at the filter <b>&quot;Ile-the-France&quot;</b>, you will see the following:</p>
<div class="">        <img src="../../../../../../../../../../../var/doc/storage/images/media/images/ez-odoscope-explorer-filter-page-navigagion/129841-1-eng-GB/eZ-odoscope-Explorer-Filter-Page-Navigagion.jpg" alt="eZ odoscope Explorer Filter Page Navigagion" />
<p>eZ odoscope Explorer Filter Page Navigagion</p>







</div><p>This means that the filter <b>&quot;Ile-de-France&quot;</b> has seven pages, and you are looking at its first page content. You can navigate on them by clicking on the left and right arrows shown together with the page numbers.</p><p><i><b>Remember:</b> Every time you select/deselect a filter, your charts/reports automatically change, according to the data available</i> <i>for the time period chosen in the <a href="../../../The-Dashboard/The-Calendar.html" target="_self">Calendar</a></i>.</p><p>You can combine filters (Ad Hoc Filtering) you use frequently and create <a href="../../Usergroups.html" target="_self">Usergroups</a>. Please, refer to the previous links in order to be familiar with both functions.</p>
