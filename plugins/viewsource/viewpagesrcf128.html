        <p>&nbsp;</p>         <p>The eZ Publish Cloud Service provides an easy to use web interface for administrators to manage environments and deployments. It can be accessed <span>via </span><a class="external-link" href="https://admin.cloud.ez.no/" rel="nofollow">https://admin.cloud.ez.no</a><span>.</span></p><p>We tried to keep the user interface as simple as possible. Therefore we limited the interface to three mayor views.</p><h3>Administration Area (Dashboard) View</h3><p>The Administration Area is the entry point after you logged in. It provides you an overview of all Environments you have access to. A click on one of the Environments in the list exposes some details of the selected environment. The details contain information according the underlying service subscription and the current deployment in the live stage. The site accesses of the live deployment and their related domains are listed. This site accesses are the public entry points to your installations, if you configured your DNS properly.</p><p>The &quot;show details&quot; link in the environment overview exposes further information like the login and password to access deployments, which are not in the live state. These credentials apply to all deployments in staging and rollback. <span>Also the credentials for the git repository of the environment and the sftp account are provided here. These accounts are ssh protected and just accessible if the user has provided a valid ssh-key.</span></p><p>To access the actual environment click on the &quot;Edit&quot; button.</p><p>If you are an administrator for the environment, you will also find a &quot;Manage Users&quot; button, which leads you to the user management view.</p><h3>User Management View</h3><p>If you have administrator rights for an environment, you can access the User Management View. Click on the “Manage Users” button in the details area of an environment.</p><p>The user management page lists all users, who have access to the selected environment. You can assign and revoke new rights to existing or new users and also remove them entirely form the environment. You cannot edit your own permissions.</p><p>To give a new user access to an environment click the “Add User” Button. The user has to be already registered as a eZ community user (<a class="external-link" href="https://login.ez.no)/" rel="nofollow">https://login.ez.no)</a> If the designated user has no account yet, please ask the user to register at login.ez.no to create a new account. You can not precede until the user was created in our system. <span>To grant access, please enter the username (as it was set on account creation for the community account). If the user is found in the users pool, it will appear in the list of users of the environment.</span></p><p>((important))All changes to the users of an environment are first collected in the browser and propagated to the server if you click the “Save Changes”. If you leave the user management page without explicit saving none of your changes will be preserved.</p><h3>Environment View</h3><p>To access the environment view click on the edit button for the desired environment.</p><p>The environment page is separated in two areas. The upper area shows the three stages of the environment with links to the according deployments. If you click on one of the deployment links the details of the deployment are revealed in the lower area. The details view of a deployment shows the current site access configuration and provides links to the site accesses. It also provides you the current status of the deployment.</p><p>Further you can create an Export of the Deployment, which provides you a database dump and a tar.gz file with the contents of the var-folder (where your Images and binary data is located. The export files can also be used to create a new deployment or to setup a local development environment with the content of the live system in the eZ-Cloud. The export files can be found at the sftp of the environment.</p><h4>Create New Deployment</h4><p>If you have no deployment in the staging stage a &quot;New Deployment&quot; button is shown, which offers you the possibility to create a new deployment.</p><p>To create a new Deployment, click on the &quot;New Deployment&quot; button in the Staging stage.</p><p>A dialog appears below the Stages. Follow the given process to create a new deployment.</p><ol><li>Enter a name for the new Deployment</li><li>Select the git tag for the source which should be used for the deployment</li><li>Click next</li><li>Select the eZ Publish version<br /><ul><li>Currently just 4.7 is supported</li><li>the auto update checkbox has no function yet, you can ignore it for now. In the future it indicates whether or not you want an automatic deployment of updates for critical errors and security issues.</li></ul></li><li>click next</li><li>Decide if you want to use the database and content of the current deployment in the Live Stage (only available if you already have a live deployment)</li><li>In case, select the <em>matching</em> db-dump and the content tar which you have uploaded before</li><li>Click Next</li><li>Review your configuration and initialize the Deployment.</li><li>you will be asked to enter a comment for the new Deployment.</li><li>confirm and the deployment process is triggered on our data center.</li></ol><p>The new Deployment will appear in the staging stage and indicate, that it is not ready yet. Once the deployment process has finished, the status of the deployment will change. </p>
